    "## Lab Assignment: Implementing Basic Control Structures and Functions\n",
    "Student:     **William Waltz**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective: To apply knowledge of basic control structures and functions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "In this lab assignment, you will be given the following seven problems to solve. Each problem requires you to implement a solution using basic control structures and functions in Python. Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand the requirements before starting to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Write a Python function to find the maximum of two numbers.\n",
    "2.  Write a Python function to find the minimum of two numbers.\n",
    "3.  Write a Python function to check if a given number is even or odd.\n",
    "4.  Write a Python program to print all the even numbers from 1 to 100.\n",
    "5.  Write a Python program to print all the odd numbers from 1 to 100.\n",
    "6.  Write a Python program to find the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100.\n",
    "7.  Write a Python program to find the factorial of a given number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverable:\n",
    "Modify this notebook to include the python code as well as any documentation related to your submission.  Submit the notebook as your response in Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctness of the implementation\n",
    "- Proper use of basic control structures and functions\n",
    "- Code efficiency\n",
    "- Clarity and readability of the code\n",
    "- Compliance with the instructions and deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Student Submission\n",
    "1.  Write a Python function to find the maximum of two numbers."
